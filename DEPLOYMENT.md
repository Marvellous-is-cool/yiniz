# Railway Deployment Guide for Yiniz

## Quick Deploy Steps:

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

- Ensure all code is committed to GitHub
- The railway.json and updated package.json are now ready

### 2. Deploy on Railway

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your `yiniz` repository
5. Railway will auto-detect Node.js and deploy

### 3. Add MySQL Database

1. In your Railway project dashboard
2. Click "New Service" → "Database" → "Add MySQL"
3. Railway will automatically create and connect the database
4. Environment variables are auto-configured

### 4. Environment Variables (Auto-configured by Railway)

Railway automatically sets these when you add MySQL:

- `MYSQL_HOST`
- `MYSQL_USER`
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
- `MYSQL_DATABASE`
- `MYSQL_PORT`

You only need to add:

- `SESSION_SECRET` (any random string)
- `NODE_ENV=production`

### 5. Database Setup

Your app will automatically work because:

- Database connection falls back to dummy data if MySQL isn't ready
- Smart connection detection in `connection.js`
- All database functions have fallback mechanisms

## Cost Breakdown:

- **App Hosting**: $5/month (Railway Pro plan)
- **MySQL Database**: $5/month (1GB storage)
- **Total**: $10/month

## Why Railway Works Perfectly:

✅ File uploads persist (unlike Vercel)
✅ MySQL included
✅ Sessions work properly
✅ No code changes needed
✅ Automatic HTTPS
✅ Custom domains
✅ Easy scaling

## Alternative Quick Deploy:

If you want free hosting, use **Render** + **PlanetScale**:

1. Deploy app on Render (free)
2. Create database on PlanetScale (free tier)
3. Connect via environment variables

Your app is actually well-architected for deployment!
