## Installation & Setup

### 1. Database Setup

Run the ML schema update:

```sql
-- Execute in your MySQL database
source database/ml_integration_schema.sql;
```

### 2. ML Service

Make sure the ML service is running on `localhost:8000`:

```bash
# The ML service should provide these endpoints:
# POST /analyze_question
# POST /analyze_answer
# GET /question_performance/{question_id}
# POST /batch_analyze
# GET /health
```

### 3. Node.js Dependencies

Required packages are already installed:

```bash
npm install node-fetch@2
```

## ML Integration Flow

### 1. Question Retrieval

```javascript
// When students request questions
1. Fetch questions from database
2. Call ML service for difficulty predictions
3. Select balanced difficulty mix
4. Return questions with ML metadata
```

### 2. Answer Submission

```javascript
// When students submit answers
1. Collect answer + timing data
2. Grade answer traditionally
3. Send to ML service for analysis
4. Store comprehensive results
5. Update question performance metrics
```

### 3. Analytics Generation

```javascript
// For teacher dashboard
1. Query student answer patterns
2. Calculate performance trends
3. Generate ML insights
4. Identify problem questions
5. Create alerts and recommendations
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic ML Analysis

```javascript
const mlService = require("../helpers/mlService");

// Analyze a question
const analysis = await mlService.analyzeQuestion({
  question: "What is 2 + 2?",
  answer_a: "3",
  answer_b: "4",
  answer_c: "5",
  answer_d: "6",
  correct_answer: "b",
});

console.log(analysis.predicted_difficulty); // "easy"
console.log(analysis.confidence); // 0.95
```

### Student Answer Analysis

```javascript
// Analyze student comprehension
const result = await mlService.analyzeAnswer({
  student_answer: "4 because 2 plus 2 equals 4",
  correct_answer: "4",
  question_text: "What is 2 + 2?",
  time_spent: 15,
});

console.log(result.comprehension_cluster); // 3 (high understanding)
console.log(result.predicted_score); // 1.0
```

### Performance Insights

```javascript
// Get question performance data
const insights = await mlService.getQuestionPerformance(questionId);

console.log(insights.success_rate); // 0.75
console.log(insights.avg_time_spent); // 45.2 seconds
console.log(insights.difficulty_trend); // "increasing"
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

- Student answers encrypted at rest
- ML service runs locally (no external data sharing)
- Anonymized data for model training

- Rate limiting on analysis requests
- Input validation for all ML calls
- Error handling to prevent data leaks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ML Service Connection Error

```bash
# Check if ML service is running
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Expected response: {"status": "healthy"}
```

#### Database Connection Issues

```sql
-- Verify ML tables exist
SHOW TABLES LIKE '%ml%';
SHOW TABLES LIKE '%student_answers%';
```

#### Missing Dependencies

```bash
# Reinstall required packages
npm install node-fetch@2
```

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by setting:

```javascript
process.env.ML_DEBUG = "true";
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Adaptive Testing**: Dynamic difficulty adjustment
